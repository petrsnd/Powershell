Powershell
==========

Useful Powershell functions and snippets that I don't want to have to rewrite
anymore. If you come across this and want to use it, go ahead. There is a BSD-
style license below to satisfy any lawyers that might bug you.

I make no claim that all of this code is original with me. I'm sure much of it
came about by borrowing and customizing whatever I've found lying about on the
Internet. I suppose any original code is copyrighted to me.

The code is written as modules that are meant to be imported.

Import-Module mod.psm1 -Force

It is usually a good idea to remove it at the end of your script.

Remove-Module mod
